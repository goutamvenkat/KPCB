Run this package through Eclipse IDE.

If only testing the BoundedQueue class then go to directory and type javac *.java and java BoundedQueue. 

To run the test, you will need to have Eclipse IDE installed or download hamcrest-core.jar 


I advise to just install Eclipse and run both the JUnit test and java file through the IDE.
